Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about Augmented Reality and Human Computer Interaction.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [prasanthsasikumar.com](prasanthsasikumar.com).

### My Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

I write regular blog posts, most of which you will find on my personal website [waylonwalker.com](https://waylonwalker.com) and [dev.to/waylonwalker](https://dev.to/waylonwalker).

I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I make things with **AR/VR** using **Unity** and **C#**.
